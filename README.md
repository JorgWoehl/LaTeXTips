# LaTeX (and LyX) typesetting tips

**LaTeX_tips.pdf** contains a collection of best practices using LaTeX (with or without LyX). 
I have compiled them primarily for my own reference, but hope that you might find them useful, too.
Check out my post on [tangents.blog](https://www.tangents.blog/2019/05/23/latex-(and-lyx)-typesetting-tips) 
for more information about the origin of this project.

The file **configJCW.sty** contains my recommended settings and can be added as a package to your TeX system. 
It is loaded in the LaTeX preamble with

    \usepackage{configJCW}
    
The file **configJCW.lyx** contains the accompanying LyX macros needed to properly display things in LyX. Insert it at the beginning of your LyX document, as described in the file.

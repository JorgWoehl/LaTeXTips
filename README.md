# LaTeX (and LyX) typesetting tips

The file **LaTeX_tips.pdf** contains my notes about best practices using LaTeX (with or without LyX). 
I have compiled them primarily for my own reference, but hope that you might find them helpful, too.

Everything was thoroughly tested with the LaTeX packages mentioned in the document 
(all versions dating back to May 2015) and LyX 2.1.0 and later, using XeTeX as the output engine. 
Each package was chosen after careful consideration of other options â€“ I decided to add a package 
only if necessary, and only after I was convinced that it was stable, written by a reputable package 
author, compatible with other packages, and under active and sustained development.

Check out my post on [tangents.blog](https://www.tangents.blog/2019/05/23/latex-(and-lyx)-typesetting-tips) 
for more information about the origin of this project.
